	<h1>Content Algin</h1>

	<p class="para1"> The margin property also affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but the margin is not included in the actual size of the box. The box's total width and height stops at the border.</p>

	<p class="para2">Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.</p>

	<p class="para3">With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.</p>

	<p class="para4">The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element! To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.</p>

	<p class="para5">When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!If you don't know what HTML is, we suggest that you read our HTML Tutorial.</p>
