	<p class="blue-bg">Bootstrap 5 is evolving with each release to better utilize CSS variables for global theme styles, individual components, and even utilities. We provide dozens of variables for colors, font styles, and more at a :root level for use anywhere. On components and utilities, CSS variables are scoped to the relevant class and can easily be modified.</p>

	<p class="blue-bg">New in Bootstrap 5, our utilities are now generated by our Utility API. We built it as a feature-packed Sass map that can be quickly and easily customized. It's never been easier to add, remove, or modify any utility classes. Make utilities responsive, add pseudo-class variants, and give them custom names.</p>

	<p class="orange-bg">Apply any of our included utility classes to our components to customize their appearance, like the navigation example below. There are hundreds of classes availableâ€”from positioning and sizing to colors and effects. Mix them with CSS variable overrides for even more control.</p>
