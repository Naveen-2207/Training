	<div>Bootstrap 5 is evolving with each release to better utilize CSS variables for global theme styles, individual components, and even utilities. We provide dozens of variables for colors, font styles, and more at a :root level for use anywhere. On components and utilities, CSS variables are scoped to the relevant class and can easily be modified.</div>

	<div id="card">New in Bootstrap 5, our utilities are now generated by our Utility API. We built it as a feature-packed Sass map that can be quickly and easily customized. It's never been easier to add, remove, or modify any utility classes. Make utilities responsive, add pseudo-class variants, and give them custom names.</div>

	<div>Apply any of our included utility classes to our components to customize their appearance, like the navigation example below. There are hundreds of classes availableâ€”from positioning and sizing to colors and effects. Mix them with CSS variable overrides for even more control.</div>
